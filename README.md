# Hardware sensitivity

This repository gathers measurements about x264 performance using different hardware platforms, taken with [Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Home)

For each hardware platform, we measure 200 configurations of [x264](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html) on eight different input videos.
The docker image used to compute the measurements is public and available in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anonymicse2021/x264_inputs).

See the data directory for more information.
